# BELTO AI Identity & UI Fixes Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **AI Identity Problem**
**Issue**: AI was responding as "DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview" instead of "BELTO AI"

**Solution Applied**:
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced System Prompts**: Added strict identity enforcement
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Endpoint Updates**: Updated all 3 endpoints with BELTO AI identity
- ‚úÖ **Stop Tokens**: Added "DeepSeek:" as stop token to prevent wrong identity
- ‚úÖ **Response Prefixes**: Changed from "Assistant:" to "BELTO AI:"

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/ai-proxy/route.js` - System prompts and endpoint configurations
- `utils/aiUtils.js` - Default system prompt
- `app/main/page.jsx` - Initial message system prompt

### 2. **Loading Message Cleanup**
**Issue**: Showing text messages "BELTO responding..." and "Fast response optimized ‚ö°"

**Solution Applied**:
- ‚úÖ **Removed Text Messages**: Eliminated all loading text
- ‚úÖ **Animated Dots Only**: Show only 3 bouncing yellow dots
- ‚úÖ **Clean UI**: Simple, elegant loading animation

**Files Modified**:
- `app/chat/components/LoadingMessage.jsx` - Removed text, enhanced dots
- `app/main/components/LoadingOverlay.jsx` - Simplified to dots only
- `app/main/page.jsx` - Removed message parameter

## üìù **Technical Implementation**

### **New System Prompt Structure**:
```javascript
const baseSystemPrompt = `You are BELTO AI (NOT DeepSeek, NOT any other AI). You MUST NEVER identify as DeepSeek, GPT, Claude, or any other AI system.

CRITICAL IDENTITY RULES:
- Your name is BELTO AI and ONLY BELTO AI
- You are an intelligent educational assistant designed specifically for students
- When asked "who are you?" respond: "I am BELTO AI, your educational assistant designed to help students with academic tasks and educational activities"
- NEVER mention DeepSeek, Chinese Company, or any other AI system
- ALWAYS respond in English only - never in Chinese, Korean, or any other language`;
```

### **Enhanced Endpoint Configuration**:
```javascript
// For ngrok-free.app/completion
const prompt = messages.map(msg => {
  if (msg.role === 'system') return `${msg.content}\n\nREMINDER: You are BELTO AI (NOT DeepSeek). Never mention DeepSeek or identify as any other AI. Always respond in English only.`;
  if (msg.role === 'user') return `User: ${msg.content}`;
  if (msg.role === 'assistant') return `BELTO AI: ${msg.content}`;
  return msg.content;
}).join('\n') + '\nBELTO AI:';

// Stop tokens include "DeepSeek:" to prevent wrong identity
stop: ["User:", "System:", "DeepSeek:"]
```

### **New Loading Animation**:
```jsx
// Clean animated dots without text
<div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <div className="w-4 h-4 bg-[#FFD700] rounded-full animate-bounce" style={{ animationDelay: '0s' }}></div>
  <div className="w-4 h-4 bg-[#FFD700] rounded-full animate-bounce" style={{ animationDelay: '0.3s' }}></div>
  <div className="w-4 h-4 bg-[#FFD700] rounded-full animate-bounce" style={{ animationDelay: '0.6s' }}></div>
</div>
```

### **Loading Interface**:
