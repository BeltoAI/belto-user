# PDF Attachment and Complex Request Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed:
1. PDF attachments showing fallback responses instead of processing
2. Complex programming requests (like "give me code to sum two numbers in java") failing
3. "AI is thinking" changed to "Belto is thinking"
4. Better error handling for different request types

## Changes Made:

### 1. Dynamic Timeout System (app/api/ai-proxy/route.js)
- Added `getTimeoutForRequest()` function that detects:
  - PDF attachments (uses 25-second timeout)
  - Large content (>1000 chars per message)
  - Programming requests (detects keywords like "code", "java", "function")
  - Total conversation length >2000 chars
- Base timeout: 8 seconds for simple requests
- Extended timeout: 25 seconds for complex requests

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages (app/chat/hooks/useAIResponse.js)
- PDF-specific error: "üìÑ I'm having trouble processing your document right now..."
- Timeout with PDF: "‚è±Ô∏è Your document is taking longer than expected to process..."
- General connectivity: "üîß I'm experiencing connectivity issues with the AI service..."

### 3. UI Updates
- LoadingMessage.jsx: "Belto is thinking..." instead of "Generating response..."
- ChatInput.jsx: "Belto is processing..." and "Belto is thinking..." placeholders

### 4. Improved Fallback System (app/api/ai-proxy/route.js)
- Context-aware fallback responses
- Different messages for PDF vs programming vs general requests
- Actionable suggestions (upload smaller files, try simpler questions)

## Expected Results:
‚úÖ PDF attachments should now process properly with 25-second timeout
‚úÖ Complex programming requests should work without triggering fallbacks
‚úÖ Better user feedback during processing
‚úÖ More helpful error messages when issues occur
‚úÖ All "AI" references changed to "Belto"

## Test Cases That Should Now Work:
1. PDF file attachments (any size)
2. "Give me code to sum two numbers in java"
3. Large document analysis
4. Complex programming questions
5. Multi-step code explanations

## Files Modified:
- app/api/ai-proxy/route.js (timeout logic, fallback responses)
- app/chat/hooks/useAIResponse.js (error handling)
- app/chat/components/LoadingMessage.jsx (UI text)
- app/components/Chat/ChatInput.jsx (UI text)

The system should now handle PDF attachments and complex requests much more reliably!
