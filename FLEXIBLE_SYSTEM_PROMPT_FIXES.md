# FLEXIBLE SYSTEM PROMPT & CODE FORMATTING FIXES

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve two critical issues:
1. **Hard-coded rejection messages** - Removed inflexible behavior
2. **Code formatting problems** - Fixed single-line code display issue

## ðŸš¨ Problems Addressed

### 1. Hard-coded System Behavior
**Problem**: The system was hard-coding rejection messages like "Sorry, I can't answer this query as it is not related to coding" regardless of the actual system prompts provided.

**Root Cause**: 
- `isCodingRelatedQuery()` function was pre-filtering all queries
- Fixed rejection message was returned without consulting system prompts
- System prompts were ignored in favor of hard-coded behavior

### 2. Code Formatting Issues
**Problem**: Code was being displayed as single lines instead of properly formatted multi-line blocks with correct indentation.

**Root Cause**: 
- Aggressive content cleaning was flattening code structure
- Code block processing was destructive to formatting
- Python indentation was being destroyed

## âœ… Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Hard-coded Query Validation

**Before**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Check if the query is coding-related before processing
const userQuery = body.prompt.toLowerCase();
if (!isCodingRelatedQuery(userQuery)) {
  console.log('ðŸš« Non-coding query detected, returning coding-only message');
  return NextResponse.json({
    response: "Sorry, I can't answer this query as it is not related to coding.",
    tokenUsage: { total_tokens: 15, prompt_tokens: 10, completion_tokens: 5 }
  });
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
// No pre-filtering - let system prompts control behavior
if (body.prompt) {
  // Process all queries and let AI respond based on system prompts
```

### 2. Dynamic System Prompt Handling

**Before**: Hard-coded CODING GURU behavior regardless of actual system prompts

**After**: Flexible system prompt processing:
```javascript
// Check if we have custom system prompts that define the AI's behavior
if (body.preferences?.systemPrompts?.[0]?.content) {
  console.log('ðŸ“‹ Using custom system prompt from preferences');
  baseSystemPrompt = body.preferences.systemPrompts[0].content;
} else if (body.aiConfig?.systemPrompts?.[0]?.content) {
  console.log('ðŸ“‹ Using custom system prompt from aiConfig');
  baseSystemPrompt = body.aiConfig.systemPrompts[0].content;
} else {
  // Default educational system prompt when no custom prompts are provided
  baseSystemPrompt = `You are BELTO AI, an intelligent educational assistant...`;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Code Block Preservation

**Before**: Destructive code cleaning that flattened formatting

**After**: Code-first preservation approach:
```javascript
function cleanResponseContent(content) {
  // STEP 1: PRESERVE ALL CODE BLOCKS FIRST - Extract and store them safely
  const codeBlocks = [];
  const codeBlockPlaceholders = {};
  let codeBlockIndex = 0;

  // Extract code blocks and replace with placeholders
  let processedContent = content.replace(/```(\w*)\n?([\s\S]*?)```/g, (match, language, code) => {
    const placeholder = `__CODE_BLOCK_${codeBlockIndex}__`;
    codeBlocks[codeBlockIndex] = {
      language: language || 'text',
      code: code.trim(), // Only trim leading/trailing whitespace, preserve internal formatting
      original: match
    };
    codeBlockPlaceholders[placeholder] = codeBlockIndex;
    codeBlockIndex++;
    return placeholder;
  });

  // STEP 2: Clean only the non-code content
  // ... cleaning logic ...

  // STEP 3: Restore code blocks with proper formatting
  Object.keys(codeBlockPlaceholders).forEach(placeholder => {
    const blockIndex = codeBlockPlaceholders[placeholder];
    const block = codeBlocks[blockIndex];
    
    if (block) {
      // Detect language if not specified
      const language = block.language || detectCodeLanguage(block.code) || 'text';
      
      // Restore the code block with original formatting preserved
      const restoredBlock = `\`\`\`${language}\n${block.code}\n\`\`\``;
      cleanedContent = cleanedContent.replace(placeholder, restoredBlock);
    }
  });
}
```

### 4. Removed Unused Functions

**Removed**:
- `isCodingRelatedQuery()` function (no longer needed)
- Hard-coded query validation logic
- Fixed rejection message handling

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior Changes

### 1. System Prompt Compliance

**CODING GURU System Prompt**:
```javascript
{
  "systemPrompts": [{
    "content": "You are a CODING GURU. You ONLY answer coding-related questions and tasks. For ANY non-coding questions, you MUST respond with appropriate rejection message."
  }]
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- Coding questions: âœ… Properly formatted code responses
- Non-coding questions: âœ… AI-generated rejection message (not hard-coded)

**General Educational System Prompt**:
```javascript
{
  "systemPrompts": [{
    "content": "You are BELTO AI, an educational assistant. You help with various subjects including history, science, mathematics, programming, etc."
  }]
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- History questions: âœ… Educational history responses
- Coding questions: âœ… Properly formatted code responses
- Science questions: âœ… Educational science responses

### 2. Code Formatting Improvements

**Before**:
```
def swap_numbers(a, b): return b, a
```

**After**:
```python
def swap_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Swap two numbers without using temporary variable
    """
    return b, a

# Alternative approach using tuple unpacking
def swap_with_temp(a, b):
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
    return a, b
```

## ðŸ§ª Validation Tests

Created comprehensive test suite in `test-flexible-system-prompts.js`:

### Test Cases:

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Examples

### For Coding-Only Behavior:
```javascript
{
  "preferences": {
    "systemPrompts": [{
      "content": "You are a CODING GURU. You ONLY answer coding-related questions. For non-coding questions, explain that you only handle programming topics."
    }]
  }
}
```

### For General Educational Behavior:
```javascript
{
  "preferences": {
    "systemPrompts": [{
      "content": "You are BELTO AI, an educational assistant. Help students with various subjects including programming, mathematics, science, history, and more."
    }]
  }
}
```

### For Subject-Specific Behavior:
```javascript
{
  "preferences": {
    "systemPrompts": [{
      "content": "You are a MATHEMATICS TUTOR. You help students with mathematical concepts, problems, and explanations. For non-math questions, redirect to math-related aspects."
    }]
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Implementation Status

- âœ… **Hard-coded validation removed**: System prompts now control behavior
