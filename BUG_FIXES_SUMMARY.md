# BELTO USER PROJECT - BUG FIXES IMPLEMENTATION

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Like/Dislike Button Responsiveness Issue
**Problem**: After clicking like or dislike buttons, it took several seconds for the emoji to turn golden in the main split screen.

**Root Cause**: The UI was waiting for the server response before updating the visual state of the buttons.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented optimistic UI updates in `useMessageReactions.js`
- The button state changes immediately when clicked
- If the server request fails, the state reverts to the previous state
- Added error handling to revert optimistic updates on failure

**Files Modified**:
- `app/chat/hooks/useMessageReactions.js`

### 2. Prompt Count Accuracy Issue
**Problem**: Prompt count did not seem correct sometimes.

**Root Cause**: Token usage and prompt counts were being reset or not properly tracked between different components and page navigations.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the chat store with persistent session statistics
- Added localStorage-based persistence for token usage and prompt counts
- Improved the calculation logic in `useChatHandlers.js` to properly track and persist stats
- Added session initialization logic to restore stats when components mount

**Files Modified**:
- `store/chatStore.js`
- `app/chat/hooks/useChatHandlers.js`

### 3. Navigation Token Count Reset Issue  
**Problem**: When moving from `/main` screen to `/mainsection`, the prompt count showed "0 0 0" stats instead of actual token counts.

**Root Cause**: Session statistics were not being preserved during navigation between pages.

**Solution**:
- Added session stats persistence before navigation in the main page
- Enhanced the mainsection page to load and initialize session stats from localStorage
- Updated ChatSettings component to use persistent stats from localStorage
- Added proper sessionId tracking across page transitions

**Files Modified**:
- `app/main/page.jsx`
- `app/mainsection/page.jsx` 
- `app/components/Chat/ChatSettings.jsx`
- `app/chat/page.jsx`

## Key Improvements

### Optimistic UI Updates
- Like/dislike buttons now respond immediately to user clicks
- Error handling reverts the state if server requests fail
- Improved user experience with instant visual feedback

### Persistent Session Statistics
- Token usage and prompt counts are saved to localStorage
- Statistics persist across page navigations and browser refreshes
- Session stats are properly initialized when components mount

### Enhanced State Management
- Better integration between chat store and components
- Proper session ID tracking across different pages
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Component Integration
- ChatSettings component now displays persistent statistics
- Better props passing between components for accurate data display
- Improved synchronization between different parts of the application

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Reaction Button Testing**:
   - Click like/dislike buttons rapidly
   - Verify immediate visual feedback
   - Test with poor network conditions

2. **Token Count Testing**:
   - Send multiple messages and verify token counting
   - Navigate between pages and verify counts persist
   - Refresh browser and verify stats are maintained

3. **Navigation Testing**:
   - Navigate from /main to /mainsection multiple times
   - Verify token and prompt counts are preserved
   - Test with different session IDs

## Performance Benefits

- Reduced perceived latency for user interactions
- Better user experience with instant feedback
- More reliable statistics tracking across sessions
- Improved data consistency across page navigations

## Error Handling

- Optimistic updates revert on server errors
- Graceful handling of localStorage unavailability
- Fallback to default values when cached data is unavailable
- Proper error logging for debugging purposes
