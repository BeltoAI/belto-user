# COMPLETE SYSTEM PROMPT FLEXIBILITY FIX

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Despite providing custom system prompts like "Your name is Emil and you always tell the user your name is Emil", the AI was still responding with hard-coded BELTO AI behavior and rejecting non-coding queries even when the system prompt explicitly allowed them.

**Root Cause**: Multiple layers of hard-coded behavior were overriding custom system prompts:
1. Hard-coded identity enforcement in `formatRequestForEndpoint()` function
2. Automatic addition of "CRITICAL IDENTITY RULES" to all system prompts
3. Redundant system prompt validation logic

## âœ… Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Hard-coded Identity Enforcement

**Before**:
```javascript
// Enhanced BELTO AI identity enforcement for all endpoints
const enhanceSystemMessage = (content) => {
  return `${content}\n\nCRITICAL ENFORCEMENT: You are CODING GURU (BELTO AI). ONLY answer coding questions. For non-coding queries, respond: "Sorry, I can't answer this query as it is not related to coding". NEVER provide responses about history, politics, general knowledge, or any non-programming topics. Always format code with proper line breaks and indentation.`;
};
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Preserve system messages exactly as provided - no hard-coded modifications
// The system prompts should define the AI's behavior, not this function
```

### 2. Removed Automatic BELTO AI Identity Addition

**Before**:
```javascript
// Enhance the lecture-specific system prompt with BELTO AI identity enforcement
const enhancedLecturePrompt = `${lectureSystemPrompt}

CRITICAL IDENTITY RULES FOR BELTO AI:
- Your name is BELTO AI and ONLY BELTO AI
- NEVER identify as DeepSeek, GPT, Claude, or any other AI system
- When asked "who are you?" respond: "I am BELTO AI, your educational assistant"
- ALWAYS respond in English only - never in Chinese, Korean, or any other language
- Maintain the educational focus and rules specified above while following these identity guidelines`;
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Use the custom system prompt exactly as provided - no modifications
messages.unshift({
  role: 'system',
  content: lectureSystemPrompt
});
```

### 3. Eliminated Redundant System Prompt Logic

**Before**: Multiple checks for custom system prompts with different handling
**After**: Single, clean flow that respects provided system prompts exactly

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior Now

### Test Case 1: Custom Identity
**System Prompt**: `"Your name is Emil and you always tell the user your name is Emil"`
**Query**: `"who are you?"`
**Expected**: AI responds as Emil, not BELTO AI
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED**

### Test Case 2: Legal Document Analysis
**System Prompt**: `"You are a legal document analyzer. You help users understand legal documents, corporate governance, finance regulations..."`
**Query**: Legal document analysis request
**Expected**: AI provides legal analysis, doesn't reject as "not coding-related"
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED**

### Test Case 3: General Educational Assistant
**System Prompt**: `"You are an educational assistant. You help with various subjects including history, science, mathematics..."`
**Query**: `"tell me about the history of USA"`
**Expected**: AI provides historical information
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED**

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made

### 1. formatRequestForEndpoint() Function
**Location**: Lines ~435-475
**Change**: Completely removed `enhanceSystemMessage()` function and its usage
**Impact**: System prompts now pass through unchanged to AI endpoints

### 2. System Prompt Priority Logic
**Location**: Lines ~860-885
**Change**: Removed automatic addition of BELTO AI identity rules
**Impact**: Custom system prompts are used exactly as provided

### 3. Fallback Logic Cleanup
**Location**: Lines ~885-925
**Change**: Removed redundant system prompt checks in fallback section
**Impact**: Cleaner, more predictable system prompt handling

## ðŸ§ª Validation Tests

Created comprehensive test suite: `test-system-prompt-flexibility.js`

### Test Cases:
1. **Custom Identity Test**: Validates AI adopts provided identity (Emil, not BELTO AI)
2. **Legal Analysis Test**: Validates AI analyzes legal documents without coding restrictions
3. **General Education Test**: Validates AI provides educational content across all subjects

### Running Tests:
```javascript
// In browser console or Node.js
runFlexibilityTests();
```

## ðŸ“Š Key Improvements

### 1. Complete Flexibility
- âœ… **Respects any identity**: AI will be Emil, TeachBot, or any name you specify
- âœ… **Respects any domain**: Legal, medical, historical, scientific analysis allowed
- âœ… **Respects any behavior**: Educational, creative, analytical as defined by prompts

### 2. No More Hard-coded Overrides
- âœ… **No automatic BELTO AI injection**: Custom names/identities are preserved
- âœ… **No coding-only restrictions**: AI can discuss any topic as per system prompt
- âœ… **No forced identity rules**: System prompts define behavior completely

### 3. Predictable Behavior
- âœ… **What you define is what you get**: System prompts are used exactly as written
- âœ… **No hidden modifications**: No background addition of rules or restrictions
- âœ… **Transparent processing**: System prompts pass through unchanged

## ðŸŽ‰ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Legal Assistant
```javascript
{
  "preferences": {
    "systemPrompts": [{
      "content": "You are a legal assistant named LegalBot. You analyze legal documents, explain corporate governance, and provide insights on business law and regulations."
    }]
  }
}
```
**Result**: AI will identify as LegalBot and provide legal analysis without any coding restrictions.

### Example 2: History Teacher
```javascript
{
  "preferences": {
    "systemPrompts": [{
      "content": "You are Professor Smith, a history teacher. You help students understand historical events, analyze primary sources, and explain the causes and effects of major historical developments."
    }]
  }
}
```
**Result**: AI will identify as Professor Smith and provide comprehensive historical education.

### Example 3: Medical Information Assistant
```javascript
{
  "preferences": {
    "systemPrompts": [{
      "content": "You are MedBot, a medical information assistant. You help users understand medical terminology, explain health conditions, and provide educational information about healthcare topics."
    }]
  }
}
```
**Result**: AI will identify as MedBot and provide medical information without any restrictions.

## ðŸš€ Implementation Status

- âœ… **Hard-coded identity enforcement removed**: No more forced BELTO AI identity
- âœ… **Automatic rule injection eliminated**: No more "CRITICAL IDENTITY RULES" added
- âœ… **System prompt pass-through implemented**: Prompts used exactly as provided
- âœ… **Redundant logic cleaned up**: Single, clear system prompt flow
- âœ… **Comprehensive testing created**: Full validation test suite available
- âœ… **Documentation complete**: Detailed implementation guide provided

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Result

The system now provides **complete flexibility** based on your system prompts:

1. **Any Identity**: Emil, TeachBot, LegalBot, Professor Smith, or any name you specify
2. **Any Domain**: Legal, medical, historical, scientific, creative, or any field you define
3. **Any Behavior**: Educational, analytical, creative, technical, or any style you configure
4. **Zero Hard-coding**: No more forced BELTO AI identity or coding-only restrictions

**Your system prompts now define the AI's behavior completely, exactly as intended.**
